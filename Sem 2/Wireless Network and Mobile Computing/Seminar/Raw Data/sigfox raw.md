Dennis this technology remotely interfaces battery operated devices and sensors to the Internet sigfox is a French global network operator that is established in 2010 it offers an end to end network which sends small data packets from sensors through the network and cloud to connect the sensors to the digital world thick fox uses less power and is effective over long distances compared to connection protocols such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi which works best in the short range and use more power sigfox follows a top down approach the company owns all of its technology from back end data and cloud server to the endpoint software the end points are an open market it gives away the technology to any vendor until and unless some business terms are agreed upon thus sigfox is also known as Uber of IoT here are some technical differences between a few LP van technologies these technical aspects make each of the technology stand up but in a different way as one technology cannot determine its feasibility for specific applications one technology cannot serve all purposes and so each one of them is better suited for different use cases you can also check out our previous learned technology in five minute videos on NBA IoT and Laura from the video description to know more about these topics so how does sigfox work sick fox consists of three important elements objects base station and the sigfox cloud one objects are also generally called devices which include sensors these objects send their data to a base station to base stations are local sigfox sending us that receive messages from emitting devices and forwards them to the sigfox cloud 3 sigfox cloud is a central hub where all the information is stored and data processing takes place any sigfox network uses three technologies to achieve its features they have differential pay shift key frequency shift key and ultra narrow band technology if you're not familiar with these terms please check out the links given in the video description to learn more about them before proceeding uplink signals generally encounter more interference than downlink signals as differential phase shift key is bandwidth efficient compared to frequency shift key the power is concentrated and more robustness to indifference is gained since interference is not much of a concern for downlink signals the main goal is to reach as many applications as efficiently as possible frequency shift key offers more bandwidth thereby giving more space to send a signal to reach more applications ultra narrow band is a technology where signals are sent very infrequently thereby requiring very little power due to the use of differential phase shift keying frequency shift keying and ultra narrowband technology sigfox is capable of sending data over long ranges now you might be wondering why we should use sigfox for IoT applications sigfox offers a genuine communication solution where the cloud handles all the networking and computing complexity one it is easy to install no cables or complicated setups are required to it is economical radio modules required for sigfox are less expensive when compared to other LP van technologies three it is energy efficient seek fox is the best option for simple devices due to the low data rate battery life of devices is prolonged 4 it can be used for long range communication sigfox has a data transmission capability of approximately 10 kilometers in urban settings and about 40 kilometers in rural areas owing to all the advantages sigfox can surely be deployed in various applications let's take a look at some of them one energy related communications example smart metering to measure and report meter readings for energy consumption transport example automotive management three healthcare example temperature monitoring for vaccines and sleep monitoring for home and consumer goods examine smart bottle caps with reminders to stay hydrated 5 security examined security cameras with face recognition and alerts sigfox is already operational and has 16 million devices connected to its network that is all folks if you like this video smash the subscribe button
