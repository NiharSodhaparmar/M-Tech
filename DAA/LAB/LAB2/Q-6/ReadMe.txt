1. Different time output for ten different randomly generated integer vectors of size 1024.

    Time taken no of micro seconds for pass 0: 170

    Time taken no of micro seconds for pass 1: 372

    Time taken no of micro seconds for pass 2: 544

    Time taken no of micro seconds for pass 3: 707

    Time taken no of micro seconds for pass 4: 902

    Time taken no of micro seconds for pass 5: 1102

    Time taken no of micro seconds for pass 6: 1221

    Time taken no of micro seconds for pass 7: 1459

    Time taken no of micro seconds for pass 8: 1625

    Time taken no of micro seconds for pass 9: 1740


2. Conclusion
    
    From the above output we can see that time of program depends on the selection of random pivot element.
