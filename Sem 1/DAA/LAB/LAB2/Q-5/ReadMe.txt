1. Different time output for ten different randomly generated integer vectors of size 1024.
    Time taken for pass 0 : 123 microseconds

    Time taken for pass 1 : 352 microseconds

    Time taken for pass 2 : 508 microseconds

    Time taken for pass 3 : 670 microseconds

    Time taken for pass 4 : 726 microseconds

    Time taken for pass 5 : 855 microseconds

    Time taken for pass 6 : 883 microseconds

    Time taken for pass 7 : 984 microseconds

    Time taken for pass 8 : 1104 microseconds

    Time taken for pass 9 : 1347 microseconds
    
2. Conclusion
    From the above output we can see that time of program depends on the selection of pivot element.
