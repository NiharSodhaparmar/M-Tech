In the realm of social media, the extensive mining of user data has enabled the prediction of sensitive individual attributes, including political and religious beliefs. While such data utilization enhances user experience through personalized services, it also poses potential harm and discrimination, particularly when influencing consequential decisions like activities, behaviors, attributes. The publication of user-generated data poses a risk of compromising individuals' privacy. This work investigates a spectrum of attribute inference attacks on user data, analyzing their implications. Furthermore, we explore diverse privacy techniques designed to counteract these attacks, aiming to contribute insights and strategies for strengthening user privacy in the context of social networks.
